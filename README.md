|---|---|---|---|---|
| ♾️ [Euler's Identity Visualisation](https://github.com/nathanfoale/Python_Programing/blob/main/my_animation.py) | October 2023 | Python | Utilising MANIM Mathematical Engine to visualise Euler's Identity, a mathematical beauty which shows the profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h08XZwRaAuk |
| 🏉 [North Melbourne FC Season Statistics](https://github.com/nathanfoale/AFL/blob/main/North_Melbourne_FC) | October 2022 | Python, Jupyter Notebook | Analysis of 2022 season statistics, looking at specific areas of the game to see which stats had the highest correlation to winning matches |
| 📈 [Linear Regression using Scikit-learn](https://github.com/nathanfoale/Machine_Learning_Algorithnms/blob/main/linear_regression) | March 2024 | Python, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Scikit-learn | Aims to understand the relationship between the amount spent on TV advertising and the resulting sales figures. By fitting a linear regression model to the data, the code estimates the linear relationship between these two variables, allowing for the prediction of sales given different levels of TV marketing expenditure. |
| 🦸 [Hero vs Villan Scoreboard](https://github.com/nathanfoale/Python_Programing/blob/main/Superhero_Scoreboard.py) | October 2021 | Python | This is about the battle game between heroes and villains. There will be summary table which includes the information of battles fought, battles won, battles lost, battles drawn, and a health value. Everytime, if there are batles or any changes in the character members, the summary table will be automatically updated. |
