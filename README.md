|---|---|---|---|---|
| ♾️ [Euler's Identity Visualisation](https://github.com/nathanfoale/Python_Programing/blob/main/my_animation.py) | October 2023 | Python | Utilising MANIM Mathematical Engine to visualise Euler's Identity, a mathematical beauty which shows the profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h08XZwRaAuk |
| 🏉 [North Melbourne FC Season Statistics](https://github.com/nathanfoale/AFL/blob/main/North_Melbourne_FC) | October 2022 | Python, Jupyter Notebook | Analysis of 2022 season statistics, looking at specific areas of the game to see which stats had the highest correlation to winning matches |
| 📈 [Linear Regression using Scikit-learn](https://github.com/nathanfoale/Machine_Learning_Algorithnms/blob/main/linear_regression) | March 2024 | Python, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Scikit-learn | Aims to understand the relationship between the amount spent on TV advertising and the resulting sales figures. By fitting a linear regression model to the data, the code estimates the linear relationship between these two variables, allowing for the prediction of sales given different levels of TV marketing expenditure. |
| 🦸 [Hero vs Villan Scoreboard](https://github.com/nathanfoale/Python_Programing/blob/main/Superhero_Scoreboard.py) | October 2021 | Python | This is about the battle game between heroes and villains. There will be summary table which includes the information of battles fought, battles won, battles lost, battles drawn, and a health value. Everytime, if there are batles or any changes in the character members, the summary table will be automatically updated. |

|---|---|---|---|
| 🏉 [Showdown Dashboard](https://github.com/nathanfoale/R_Scripts/blob/main/AFL_stats_dashboard) | April 2024 | R | Utilising FitzRoy packages to pull data from all matches between Port Adelaide and Adelaide, allowing the user to select a stat category and view highest player totals and averages from showdown matches. |
| 🏉 [AFL Dashboard](https://github.com/nathanfoale/R_Scripts/blob/main/AFL_stats_dashboard) | April 2024 | R | Utilising FitzRoy packages to pull data from all AFL matches in a season selected by the user, allowing user to select a stat category and view highest player totals and averages from that season. |
| 🏉 [Brownlow Predictor](https://github.com/nathanfoale/R_Scripts/blob/main/Brownlow_regression_analysis) | May 2024 | R | Utilising FitzRoy packages to pull data from all AFL match data, including brownlow votes, to show correlations and relationships between certain statistics and brownlow votes. Regression analysis used to make predictions. |
